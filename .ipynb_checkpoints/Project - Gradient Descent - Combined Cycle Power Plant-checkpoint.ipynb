    "## Gradient Descent - Boston Dataset\n",
    "Boston dataset is one of the datasets available in sklearn.\n",
    "You are given a Training dataset csv file with X train and Y train data. As studied in lecture, your task is to come up with Gradient Descent algorithm and thus predictions for the test dataset given.\n",
    "Your task is to:\n",
    "    1. Code Gradient Descent for N features and come with predictions.\n",
    "    2. Try and test with various combinations of learning rates and number of iterations.\n",
    "    3. Try using Feature Scaling, and see if it helps you in getting better results. \n",
    "Read Instructions carefully -\n",
    "    1. Use Gradient Descent as a training algorithm and submit results predicted.\n",
    "    2. Files are in csv format, you can use genfromtxt function in numpy to load data from csv file. Similarly you can use savetxt function to save data into a file.\n",
    "    3. Submit a csv file with only predictions for X test data. File name should not have spaces. File should not have any headers and should only have one column i.e. predictions. Also predictions shouldn't be in exponential form. \n",
    "    4. Your score is based on coefficient of determination.\n"
